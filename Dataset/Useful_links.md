3. Tune hyperparameters for XG boost with all these features and check the error metric.


4. At the end in your conclusions section please elaborate on the step by step procedure you followed to solve this case study.

5. Please note that based on the results you get the team can request you to implement different models/featurizations/plotting other than what we have mentioned in the instruction videos.
